[pytest]
markers =
    unit: unit tests (fast, no external service dependencies)
    integration: integration tests (requires external services such as MongoDB)

# NOTE: CI runs unit tests only with -m "not integration" to avoid requiring MongoDB
# Use `pytest -m integration` or `pytest tests/integration` to run integration tests
